        <p> Poverty-level income for one person in the United States is $12,060.
          For each additional person in the household, the income goes up $4,180.
          In Alaska, the poverty-level income for one person is $15,060, and in Hawaii it is $13,860.
          According to U.S. Census Bureau, 13.5 percent of Americans and nearly 20 percent of American
          children live at or below poverty level.

        <h2>Correlations Between Healthcare and Poverty</h2>
          <p>According to the data, the highest poverty levels do not correlate with the highest
            lack of healthcare. Although Mississippi and New Mexico have the highest poverty rate,
            Texas is the state that lacks healthcare the most. Massachusetts is the leader in healthcare
            but does not have the lowest poverty level in the country. The reason is because Massachusetts
            passed a healthcare reform law in 2006 with the aim of providing health insurance to nearly all
            of its residents.  
          </p>
        <h2>Correlations between Healthcare and Age</h2>
          <p>People between the age of 36-40 are the highest group lacking healthcare. 
          </p>
        <h2>Correlations Healthcare and Income</h2>
          <p>Higher income states does not correlate to fewer people without healthcare.
            For example, Maryland has the highest level of income with 9.2% lacking healthcare.
            The level of income in Wisconsin is much less, however, only 8.5% lack healthcare.
